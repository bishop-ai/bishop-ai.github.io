# How to contribute

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to the project.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to bishop-ai](https://github.com/bishop-ai/bishop-ai/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Tests for the work done in the request are appreciated, we can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > Optional paragraph describing what changed and its impact.
    >
    > - Bullets for each file changed with a very short summary"

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * Indent using 4 spaces (soft tabs)
  * Use Unix line endings (LF)
  * Use [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) with config file (.jshintrc)
  * Keep JS in .js, CSS in .css, HTML in .html
  * Follow [AngularJS](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide) best practices

Thank you for your contribution!
